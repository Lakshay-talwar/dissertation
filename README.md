**Abstract:**
In my dissertation, submitted for partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Data Science and Analytics program at Cardiff University, focuses on applying various data classification models to a car evaluation dataset. The goal is to predict under which conditions customers are likely to purchase a car. This study employs seven different classification algorithms and evaluates their performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The findings indicate that supervised algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors, perform exceptionally well. Support Vector Machine is identified as the most suitable algorithm for the car evaluation dataset.

**Introduction:**
Cars play a significant role in our daily lives, and choosing the right automobile involves considering factors like price, safety, comfort, and appearance. This dissertation explores classification techniques to predict car purchase decisions based on various attributes. The dataset contains information on car price, maintenance cost, number of doors, seating capacity, luggage space, safety, and the condition of the car. The study aims to enhance the prediction of car quality evaluation, ultimately contributing to the reduction of accidents and improved customer satisfaction.

**Literature Review:**
The paper reviews the dataset and the importance of machine learning techniques in classifying and predicting the condition of cars. It discusses different machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naïve Bayesian classifiers. The Gaussian Naïve Bayesian classifier is also explored in the context of text categorization.

**Methodology:**
The author applies a range of classification algorithms to the car evaluation dataset and compares their performance. The process involves data cleaning, encoding categorical features, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training the algorithms on the training data. The testing dataset is then used to evaluate the algorithms and measure their accuracy.

**Tools and Kit:**
The study is conducted using Google Colaboratory, which provides a platform for running Python code in a web browser. This tool is particularly suited for machine learning and data analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Exploratory data analysis is conducted to visualize and understand the relationships between various features and the decision variable in the dataset. This step helps to identify patterns and potential correlations between car attributes and purchase decisions.

**Conclusion:**
The dissertation concludes that the Support Vector Machine algorithm outperforms other classification techniques, with an accuracy rate of 97%. Accurate identification of car quality evaluation can contribute to reducing accidents and improving customer satisfaction. Future research could focus on more sophisticated techniques, larger datasets, and extended analysis beyond compact car brands.

This dissertation provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning for car evaluation and lays the foundation for further research in this field.
